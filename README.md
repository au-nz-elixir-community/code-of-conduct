# AU & NZ Elixir Community Code of Conduct

This code of conduct, or appropriate variations of it, applies to the AU & NZ Elixir Community Slack community
(http://aunz-elixir.slack.com).
As appropriate, it will include any events, projects, or future services provided by this community.

It is based on the Geek Feminism community anti-harassment policy found here:
http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy,
and will be periodically updated to reflect any changes in the original version.
