Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the

  parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent
  or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.

  self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect
  vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

AU & NZ Elixir Community prioritises marginalised people's safety over privileged people's comfort.
AU & NZ Elixir Community Admins will not act on complaints regarding:

* "Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", and "cisphobia"
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "Leave me alone", "Go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you."
* Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial
* Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of AU & NZ Elixir Community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact one of the AU & NZ Elixir Community Admins members on Slack by private message.
The current Admins list can be found [here](./admins.md).

If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.
We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to AU & NZ Elixir Community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of
AU & NZ Elixir Community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it.
We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by AU & NZ Elixir Community members, especially the Admins, seriously.
This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.
The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from AU & NZ Elixir Community based on their past behavior,
including behavior outside AU & NZ Elixir Community spaces
and behavior towards people who are not in AU & NZ Elixir Community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been
made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn
third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of AU & NZ Elixir Community members or
the general public.
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, AU & NZ Elixir Community Admins may take any action they deem
appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all AU & NZ Elixir Community spaces and identification of the
participant as a harasser to other AU & NZ Elixir Community members or the general public.
