## Longer version

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all DevOps NZ spaces, including Slack group, events and projects; both online and off.
Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the DevOps NZ Admins.

Some DevOps NZ spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants.
Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality,
  physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and
  employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent or after a request
  to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from
  intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

DevOps NZ prioritises marginalised people's safety over privileged people's comfort.
DevOps NZ Admins will not act on complaints regarding:

* "Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", and "cisphobia"
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "Leave me alone", "Go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you."
* Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial
* Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of DevOps NZ, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
one of the DevOps NZ Admins members on Slack by private message.
The current Admins list can be found [here](./admins.md).

If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.
We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to DevOps NZ spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of DevOps NZ outside our spaces, we still want
to know about it.
We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by DevOps NZ members, especially the Admins, seriously.
This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.
The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from DevOps NZ based on their past behavior, including behavior outside DevOps NZ spaces
and behavior towards people who are not in DevOps NZ.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about
them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of DevOps NZ members or the general public.
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, DevOps NZ Admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion
from all DevOps NZ spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other DevOps NZ members or the general public.
